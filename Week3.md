# Week 3

In Week 3, you'll explore specifics of data cataloging and ingestion, and learn about services like AWS Transfer Family, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose, Kinesis Analytics, AWS Snow Family, AWS Glue Crawlers, and others. You'll also discover when is the right time to process data--before, after, or while data is being ingested. Given scenarios, you'll be able to easily identify when to process data and match the most appropriate AWS services to each scenario.

## Learning Objectives
* Differentiate between structured and unstructured data
* Identify the right time to ingest data
* Differentiate between batch and steaming data ingestion
* Discover the benefits of data cataloging
